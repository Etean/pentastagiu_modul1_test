Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.

n Black-box testing, a tester doesn't have any information about the internal working of the software system. 
Black box testing is a high level of testing that focuses on the behavior of the software. 
It involves testing from an external or end-user perspective. 
Black box testing can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system, and acceptance.

White-box testing is a testing technique which checks the internal functioning of the system. 
In this method, testing is based on coverage of code statements, branches, paths or conditions. 
White-Box testing is considered as low-level testing. 
It is also called glass box, transparent box, clear box or code base testing. 
The white-box Testing method assumes that the path of the logic in a unit or program is known.
