Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)
Waterfall - which might be more properly called the “traditional” approach, and waterfall model is ideal for projects which have defined requirements,
and no changes are expected. The waterfall is easy to manage, sequential, and rigid method.
Agile- a specific type of Rapid Application Development and newer than Waterfall, but not that new, which is often implemented using Scrum, and 
agile is best suited where there is a higher chance of frequent requirement changes, and is very flexible and it possible to make changes in any phase.
In Agile process, requirements can change frequently. However, in a waterfall model, it is defined only once by the business analyst.
In Agile Description of project, details can be altered anytime during the SDLC process which is not possible in Waterfall method.
